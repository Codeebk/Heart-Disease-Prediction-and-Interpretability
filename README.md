# Heart-Disease-Prediction-and-Interpretability
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning models for predicting heart disease and explores advanced interpretability techniques using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations). The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretability analysis.
